[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/LarsKrogJensen/graphql-kotlin/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/LarsKrogJensen/graphql-kotlin/tree/master)

This is a GraphQL implementation in the Kotlin language and is initially a port of [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java). 
This implementation includes async datafetcher implementaion based on a [graphql-java promise fork](https://github.com/akhahaha/graphql-java/tree/promises).

The rationale behind this effort is to learn GraphQL and Kotlin more deeply, and ofcourse alot of fun.
